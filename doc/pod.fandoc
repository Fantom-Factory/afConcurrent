Overview [#overview]
********************
*'Concurrent' is a support library that aids Alien-Factory in the development of other libraries, frameworks and applications.
Though you are welcome to use it, you may find features are missing and the documentation incomplete.*

'Concurrent' builds upon the standard Fantom [concurrent library]`http://fantom.org/doc/concurrent/index.html` and provides a collection of utility classes for sharing data between threads.



Install [#Install]
******************
Install 'Concurrent' with the Fantom Repository Manager ( [fanr]`http://fantom.org/doc/docFanr/Tool.html#install` ):

  C:\> fanr install -r http://repo.status302.com/fanr/ afConcurrent

To use in a [Fantom]`http://fantom.org/` project, add a dependency to 'build.fan':

  depends = ["sys 1.0", ..., "afConcurrent 0+"]



Usage [#usage]
**************
The 'Concurrent' library provides a few strategies for sharing data:



Synchronized [#synchronized]
============================
`Synchronized` provides synchronized serial access to a block of code, akin to Java's 'synchronized' keyword.
Extend the 'Synchronized' class to use the familiar syntax:

pre>
const class Example : Synchronized {
    new make() : super(ActorPool()) { }

    Void main() {
        synchronized |->| {
            // ...
            // important stuff
            // ...
        }
    }
}
<pre

'Synchronized' works by calling the function from within the 'receive()' method of an [Actor]`concurrent::Actor`, which has important implications.
First, the passed in function needs to be an [immutable func]`sys::Func`.
Next, any object returned also has to be immutable (preferably) or serializable.

Instances of 'Synchronized' may also be used as a mechanism for exclusive locking. For example:

pre>
class Example {
    Synchronized lock := Synchronized(ActorPool())

    Void main() {
        lock.synchronized |->| {
            // ...
            // important stuff
            // ...
        }
    }
}
<pre



Atomic [#atomic]
================
Atomic Lists and Maps are similar to their Synchronized counterparts in that they are backed by an object held in an 'AtomicRef'.
But their write operations are *not* synchronized.
This means they are much more *lightweight* but it also means they are susceptible to **data-loss** during race conditions between multiple threads.
If used for caching situations where it is not essential for values to exist, this may be acceptable.



Local [#local]
==============
Local Refs, Lists and Maps do not share data between threads, in fact, quite the opposite!

They wrap data stored in 'Actor.locals()' thereby constraining it to only be accessed by the executing thread.
The data is said to be *local* to that thread.

But data held in 'Actor.locals()' is susceptible to being overwritten due to name clashes. Consider:

pre>
class Drink {
    Str beer {
      get { Actor.locals["beer"] }
      set { Actor.locals["beer"] = it }
    }
}

man := Drink()
man.beer = "Ale"

kid := Drink()
kid.beer = "Ginger Ale"

echo(man.beer)  // --> Ginger Ale (WRONG!)
echo(kid.beer)  // --> Ginger Ale
<pre

To prevent this, `LocalRef` creates a unique qualified name to store the data under:

pre>
class Drink {
    LocalRef beer := LocalRef("beer")
}

man := Drink()
man.beer.val = "Ale"

kid := Drink()
kid.beer.val = "Ginger Ale"

echo(man.beer.val)   // --> Ale
echo(kid.beer.val)   // --> Ginger Ale

echo(man.beer.qname) // --> 0001.beer
echo(kid.beer.qname) // --> 0002.beer
<pre

While 'LocalRefs' are not too exiting on their own, [BedSheet]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet#.U2FhEihfyJA` and [IoC]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afIoc#.U2FfiihfyJA` use them to keep track of data to be cleaned up at the end of HTTP web requests.

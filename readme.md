# Concurrent

*`Concurrent` is a support library that aids Alien-Factory in the development of libraries, frameworks and applications.
Though you are welcome to use it, you may find features are missing and the documentation incomplete.*

'Concurrent' builds upon the standard Fantom [concurrent library]`http://fantom.org/doc/concurrent/index.html` and provides a collection of utility classes for sharing data between threads.



## Install

Install `Concurrent` with the Fantom Respository Manager ( [fanr](http://fantom.org/doc/docFanr/Tool.html#install) ):

    $ fanr install -r http://repo.status302.com/fanr/ afConcurrent

To use in a [Fantom](http://fantom.org/) project, add a dependency to `build.fan`:

    depends = ["sys 1.0", ..., "afConcurrent 0+"]



## Documentation

Full API & fandocs are available on the [status302 repository](http://repo.status302.com/doc/afConcurrent/#overview).
